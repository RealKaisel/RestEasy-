1- The Project contains of 2 main folders, frontend and backend.

2- The user is required to download both files

3- Then then create a separate new folder, lets call it "FP" extracting both frontend and backend files inside.

4- After this, all required dependencies like NodeJS, Express.JS and React are to be downloaded on the device, this will also download a bunch of files
like node modules etc, but technically they are also all inside my frontend and backend folders, so it could be a good idea to delete them.

5- Now, the new folder "FP", with both frontend and backend files extracted inside, should be opened inside a working environment like VScode

6- If node, express and react are properly installed, and both folders are present in the directory, the applicaiton is ready to use.

7- Use vscode's integrated terminal, in the backend folder, and use the command "node server.js"

8- Then, do the same for the frontend folder, proceed to the "App.js" file, open its integrated terminal, and run the command "npm start."

9- If all these instructions are followed properly, the React app should launch in the users browser.

10- All you need are the full frontend and backend folders. Nothing else, you can even git rid of all the files the command
terminal automatically downloads, just make sure you have node.js downloaded from their website and you have mode sure your 
vscode environment has everything necessary.

11- Enjoy RestEasy!
