The Project contains of 2 main folders, frontend and backend.
The user is required to download both files
and then create a separate new folder, lets call it "FP" extracting both frontend and backend files inside.
After this, all required dependencies like NodeJS, Express.JS and React are to be downloaded on the device
Now, the new folder "FP", with both frontend and backend files extracted inside, should be opened inside a working environment like VScode
If node, express and react are properly installed, and both folders are present in the directory, the applicaiton is ready to use.
Use vscode's integrated terminal, in the backend folder, and use the command "node server.js"
Then, do the same for the frontend folder, proceed to the "App.js" file, open its integrated terminal, and run the command "npm start."
If all these instructions are followed properly, the React app should launch in the users browser.
Enjoy RestEasy!
